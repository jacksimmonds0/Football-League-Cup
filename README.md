# Football-League-Cup
COM1028 Software Engineering Project

As part of the first year module at the University of Surrey - Software Engineering a large Java project was undertaken, and the one I chose to do was a combined football league and cup system.

To run the project - run the LeagueUI.java file

In hindsight I should have added better project directory structure with the packages i.e. split up league, cup and shared classes into different packages.
